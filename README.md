This project aims to predict daily climate data using time series forecasting techniques.

Daily Climate Prediction using Time Series Forecasting
Overview
This project aims to predict daily climate data using time series forecasting techniques. The data is collected from various weather stations and includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the weather conditions for the next day based on historical data.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
•	Python 3.x
•	Pandas
•	NumPy
•	Matplotlib
•	Scikit-learn
•	Jupyter Notebook (optional)
Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository to your local machine:
bashCopy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-climate-prediction.git 
2.	Install the required packages:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt 
3.	Run the climate_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook, or run the climate_prediction.py script using the command:
Copy code
python climate_prediction.py 
Data
The dataset used in this project is a public weather dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains daily weather data from various weather stations around the world. The data is collected over several years and includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The data is stored in a CSV file and can be downloaded from the following link:

Model
In this project, we use the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting. ARIMA is a popular technique for modeling and predicting time series data. It combines autoregression (AR) and moving average (MA) techniques to capture the temporal dependencies in the data.
We first preprocess the data by cleaning it and transforming it into a stationary time series. We then fit an ARIMA model to the data and use it to make daily climate predictions.
Conclusion
In this project, we have shown how to use time series forecasting techniques to predict daily climate data. We used the ARIMA model to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the weather conditions for the next day. This project can be extended to include more weather features and to build more complex models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
